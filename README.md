# gwrobolib
This repository is for the source code for the robotics library created originally by @omn0mn0m for use with the GW Robotics 2017 Trinity College Firefighting Robot Contest. The goal of this library is to allow the user to easily write Python code to be run on a Raspberry Pi interfacing with an Arduino as its I/O board.
